I plan on doing a project related to cyber security. Projects I am currently looking into are Shad0w, Hack Tools, and Packetwhisper.
I most likly will be joining an existing project, not making one of my own. If I do start a new project I plan to follow the common repository model.
For a small scale project, I think this model will be easiest to maintain and won't slow down the project.
